# Quantum-BB84-Protocol
A Python implementation of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol using Qiskit. This project demonstrates secure quantum key exchange between Alice and Bob, simulates eavesdropping (Eve), and applies the generated quantum key for simple XOR-based encryption and decryption.
